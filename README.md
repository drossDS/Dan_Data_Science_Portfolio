## [Classification Project (Kaggle):  "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster"](https://github.com/drossDS/Project-Classification-Titanic_Machine_Learning)
Data for passengers on the Titanic is provided and a machine learning classification model is written to predict the survival of a subset of the passengers
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on passenger data to find trends and inform feature engineering

- Employed hypothesis testing validate the statistical significance of engineered features
- Examined the performance of Logistic Regression, K-Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier models
- Used GridSearchCV to optimize models to increase model accuracy
- ShuffleSplit was employed to generate training and validation sets reduce overfitting by simulating the effects of unseen data
